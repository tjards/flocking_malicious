# Flocking Control Against Malicious AgentsThis project investigates swarming with malicious agents that intentionally falsify their control parameters in order to cause collisions, divide, or escape from the swarm. This is an implemenation of the work proposed in Ref. 1, with added features for auto-assembly from random initial conditions via pinning control.# MethodologyThe technique uses a hierarchical geometric configuration-based methodology, where agents immediately neighbouring the malicious agent surround and apply force (through custom collective potential functions) in order to contain the malicious behaviour. The outermost agents then wrap themselvesaround these inner agents. This approach relies on assumptions about the underlying structure of the malicious agent controllers, but the controlparameters (i.e., gains) are not known; these gains are then learned usingfiltering techniques. The swarm is initially assembled using pinning control. Agents are represented as graph components, where each component agrees on a pin based on maximum degree centrality. They share a common target. As the graph components approach the target, they merge and become one large graph. Once the graph is assembled, a random agent begins acting maliciously. # DemonstrationsBelow is an example of a traditional swarm not able to compensate for a malicious agent (in red) attempting to collide with its neighbours:<p float="center">    <img src="./visualization/public/cao_animation3D_00.gif" width="30%">      <img src="./visualization/public/cao_malicious_0.png" width="30%"></p>Below is an example of the proposed technique effectively containing the malicious agent. Note small flucuations while the agents learn the malicious agent's control parameters.<p float="center">    <img src="./visualization/public/cao_animation3D_11.gif" width="30%">      <img src="./visualization/public/cao_malicious_1.png" width="30%"></p># References 1.
